# WTF – Smartlink Terrible Crypto

This is an implementation of the crypto (RC4) algorithm TP-Link
Easy Smart Switches use to encrypt their configuration
traffic with.

It also includes the key they use for this because they use
one key globally. Idiots!

Thanks to @jdi-li who reverse-engineered the algorithm and
they key (by decompiling some badly-obfuscated Java code).
He's implementing an open source tool to communicate with
the switches: https://github.com/jdi-li/smrtlink

# The Algorithm

Turns out this is actually the [ RC4 ](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4#Pseudo-random_generation_algorithm_.28PRGA.29) (which I didn't recognise).

Thanks to @BenBE1987 for pointing this out!

# Building
